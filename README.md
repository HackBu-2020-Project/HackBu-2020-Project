## Introduction
  Finding grant applications is a hard process to begin with — non-profits often struggle to find clear information about granting opportunities from statewide, national, and local foundations

  For many small non-profits, the best source of grant money is within the local community through local community foundations, but finding these foundations can be elusive.
  
 Search tools such as Foundation Directory Online exist to help non-profits find grantmakers and access information about their donor histories — but they’re overly complex and fail to focus in on information on local community foundations.
 
  Our product locates a non-profit within a city and only displays the community foundations that are nearby, and also provides information on local non-profits to potential donors.
  
## Objective
  * To connect local non-profits to nearby community foundations
  * Create clearer search criteria that limits the resuls of foundation searching
  * Create transparency between nonprofits and community foundations by making grantmaking information open to the public
  
## Future Improvements
  * More secure user verification process
  * Grant location page based on distance matrix
  * Database through a server, not locally stored
  * Payment method implemented into donation page
